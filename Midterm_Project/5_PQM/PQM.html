                his is a core scientific track of the program that combines in depth education in modern solid state
                physics and photonics with courses on innovation and commercialization. The track starts with three
                intensive prerequired courses on quantum mechanics, photonics and innovation that introduce student to
                the field and followed by a wide variety of elective courses allowing student to elaborate a track that
                fits his scientific interests in a best way. Access to the world-class laboratories and friendly and
                inspiring environment ensures that most of our graduates has at least one publication in high-impact
                journal.

                The track aims to educate students to work on the industrial oriented problems of modern photonics. In
                addition to the fundamental knowledge in photonics including classical and quantum approaches, the
                students are supposed to go through intense optical practicum and selected electrical, mechanical and
                software engineering disciplines. The thesis work on this track aims to solve industrial oriented
                problems and will introduce student to the state of art photonic technologies and allow to acquire
                experience in communication with typical industrial processes.

                    improve your English skills by studying in a multicultural environment, get international academic
                    experience by exchange programs with the top universities around the world. During the two-years MSc
                    program in Photonics at Skoltech I had an exchange semester in Canada and an expedition to Lake
                    Baikal. Also, I had the opportunity to learn from intelligent qualified professors from the top
                    universities, and also study with outstanding fellows always driven by an innovative spirit. I
                    deeply value being a Skoltech alumni. It certainly contributed greatly to my further career and
                    achievements in life.
